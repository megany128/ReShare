# ReShare - App Overview
12SDD - MEGAN YAP FINAL PROJECT

ReShare is an app designed for organisations and individuals to share their extra resources with those who need it - our goal is to connect those who have more than they need with NGOs who are looking for resources. ReShare boasts a wide range of features, allowing you to:
- Create offers with an image as well as various fields of information such as category and location
- Filter and search offers to find which best fits your needs
- View a personalised and curated offer list from the particular donors you choose to follow
- Request offers and send private messages to other users in order to confirm transaction details

There are also a range of safety features available - to prevent users from taking advantage of the system, only verified organisations are allowed to accept offers. Additionally, if a particular offer seems suspicious to anyone, there is an easily accessible button to report it to the moderators, who will personally check and verify the data.

Don't let your additional resources go to waste - care to share with ReShare.

# FAQs
- Why does the app display an error after I log in?

Unfortunately, the API being used has several issues. This means that the login process sometimes does not work. If you have this error,
please quit the app and try logging in again. If this still does not work, please contact megany128@gmail.com

- Why does updated information not render immediately?

Due to storage and rendering restrictions, updates may not be able to appear immediately. Please be patient and refresh the screen
or quit and reopen the app if necessary.

- Why does the user interface look weird?

As I am using one language to program for both iOS and Android, some features don't translate well across the platforms.
One of these is user interface, so please bear with it. The app may not look as nice on different-sized devices.

- I have a Firebase Storage error. What do I do?

Due to financial constraints, users can only store a certain number of images per day. Unfortunately, you will have to wait till tomorrow for the app to regain functionality.

- Why does it say 'network error'?

This is an API issue. Please dismiss the error and try again.

- Why do category and location reset when I edit my offer?

This is a constraint with the package used and unfortunately, it is not possible to fix this. Please just set the category and location again.
